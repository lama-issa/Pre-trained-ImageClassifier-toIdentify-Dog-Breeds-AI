Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
not
The VGG and ResNet models classified the dog breed correctly as a "husky," while AlexNet incorrectly classified it as a "malamute."

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:
not
VGG and ResNet provided different classifications for Dog_02.jpg compared to Dog_01.jpg. AlexNet incorrectly classified both images as different breeds. 


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
yes ,three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
vgg is the best because it accurately classified all images, including both dog breeds and non-dog objects.
